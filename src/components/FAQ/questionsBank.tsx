        question:"How does solar generate savings?",
        answer:"Solar energy generates savings by reducing or offsetting a business's or homeowner's electricity bills. When solar panels are installed on a property, they generate electricity from sunlight, which can be used to power appliances and equipment within the property. This means that the property owner will need to purchase less electricity from the grid, resulting in lower electricity bills. In addition to reducing electricity bills, solar energy can also generate savings through the various incentives and programmes offered by governments and utilities to encourage the adoption of solar energy. In Singapore, businesses and homeowners who install solar PV systems can enjoy enhanced capital allowances and net metering, which allows excess solar energy to be sold back to the grid for credits. Moreover, solar energy can also help businesses and homeowners hedge against future electricity price increases, which can result in significant savings over the long term. With solar energy, businesses and homeowners can lock in their electricity costs at a fixed rate and reduce their exposure to volatile electricity prices. In Singapore, the advantages of solar energy systems outweigh the initial investment amount. What’s more, even if a solar energy system is financed, it still pays for itself and generates more money every month in savings than the money which is paid back for the financing. The net result being positive, solar energy systems have become a “no-brainer” for all as essentially they are free if you consider the immediate savings.

        question:"Does solar work in rainy weather?",
        answer:"Solar panels can still generate electricity during rainy weather, although their efficiency will be reduced. This is because solar panels rely on sunlight to generate electricity, and rainy weather typically means less sunlight is available. Modern solar panels are designed to be relatively efficient even in low-light conditions, so they can still generate some electricity even on cloudy or rainy days. In fact, some types of solar panels are specifically designed to perform better in low-light conditions. It's also worth noting that solar panels don't need direct sunlight to work - they can still generate electricity on overcast days or in shaded areas, although again, their efficiency will be lower. Overall, while rainy weather can affect the amount of electricity generated by solar panels, they can still be a valuable source of renewable energy even in less-than-ideal conditions. In South-East Asia and Singapore for example, there will be a seasonal variation in the production of solar panels which we can see throughout the months. The drop in solar energy production during rainy months would be circa 30-40% as compared to hot months. Modern solar design software can predict seasonal energy production with 80-90% accuracy. The more precise the design, the more exact will be your savings' prediction! Our expert team at SG Solar Home can help you with an optimal solar system design for your home or business.
